# David's Project

##Problem Statement
-----------------
Create a site where Madison College Students can post items for sale, trade, carpooling, roommates wanted and many other things.
Students usually post thier want/unwanted items on the bulletin boards around campus. Having access to a page where you could post 
anything they'd want on would be easier for students rather than printing and posting on the bulletin boards on campus. This site will also make it easier to browse the items for sale also.
