# David's Project

##Problem Statement
-----------------
Create a site where Madison College Students can post items for sale, trade, carpooling, roommates wanted and many other things.
Students usually post thier want/unwanted items on the bulletins around the school. Having access to a page where you could post 
anything they'd want on would be easier for students to search for also.
